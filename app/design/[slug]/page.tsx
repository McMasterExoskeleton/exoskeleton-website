        <strong>Electrical Actuation & Sensing Team</strong>
        <br />
        The electrical actuation and sensing team designs and integrates the
        sensors and motors that enable responsive, real-time interaction with
        the user's movement. From precise IMU data to reliable motor control
        signals, we build the systems that sense, react, and move.
        <br />
        As a general member, you'll work on designing circuits, selecting
        components, managing clean wiring, and helping program embedded systems.
        You'll also collaborate closely with software and mechanical teams to
        make sure everything fits together, and works safely.
        <br />
        If you're excited by embedded systems, signal pathways, or the challenge
        of making hardware smarter and more responsive, apply now!
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Power Architecture Team</strong>
        <br />
        The Power Architecture team ensures the exoskeleton runs safely and
        efficiently. From regulating voltages to distributing power to all
        onboard systems, we handle the electrical backbone of the suit.
        <br />
        As a general member, you'll help design power distribution circuits, lay
        out PCBs, and get hands-on with wiring, soldering, and testing. We work
        on safety-critical systems, so attention to detail and clean
        implementation matter.
        <br />
        If you're passionate about electronics, enjoy building and testing
        circuits, and want to work on systems to power the suit, apply now!

    details: (
      <>
        <strong>Joint Actuation Team</strong>
        <br />
        The Joint Actuation team is responsible for the motor and gearbox
        development of all powered joints in the exoskeleton. Members will work
        closely with the Biomechanics team to corroborate joint design and the
        Electrical team to confirm motor compatibility and actuation.
        <br />
        As a general member you will work on spec calculations, gearbox and
        joint design, and motor selection. Members will apply knowledge in
        gearbox design, robotics, and kinematics to develop the powered
        functionality of the exoskeleton.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Biomechanics Team</strong>
        <br />
        The Biomechanics team is responsible for the exoskeleton's ability to
        withstand static and dynamic loads without hindering the pilot's range
        of motion. Members will work closely with pilots regarding limb and
        joint design to better align with the pilot's natural motion and improve
        ergonomics.
        <br />
        As a general member you will work on limb and joint design, ergonomics,
        and material selection. Members will apply biomechanics and engineering
        mechanics to develop the wearable and rigid capability of the
        exoskeleton.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Power Integration Team</strong>
        <br />
        The Power Integration team is responsible for the integration and
        packaging of all electrical components worn by the pilot, while
        considering thermal management, safety measures, and accessibility.
        Members will work closely with the Electrical team to plan the power
        electronics architecture and the Joint Actuation team for wire
        harnessing.
        <br />
        As a general member you will work on packaging design, electrical
        documentation, thermal and safety considerations, and material
        selections. Members will use knowledge in batteries, power electronics
        and robotics to develop the mechanical-electrical integration solutions
        powering the exoskeleton.
